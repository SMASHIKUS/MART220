    I did this assignment a little differently. I opted to not use generetive AI but I still wanted to be able to reflect on another piece so I went online and found a
sketch that someone else had done with p5.js and made some of my own additions and improvements. I have to say I'm quite pleased with the result—it looks super
trippy and I'll probably turn it into a screensaver at some point. I added movement and screen wrapping to the shapes, gave them a faint trail and turned the 
background black. I also changed the var to let to reflect a more modern method. I think the additions really changed the feeling of the entire scetch. 

    As for reflecting on AI, I really have no qualms with it's usage other than it's ecological effects and it's effects on the art community. I've even searched for 
green AI models because coding withot AI is excessively complicated, but alas have turned up nothing in my search. At this point I'm debating attempting to train my own
AI model on renewable energy and ethically sourced data. That's another aspect of AI that makes me a little uncomfortable is how the data to train them is being obtained.
I believe whole heartedly in progression and I don't think AI is going anywhere but an option that is trained on renewable energy and ethically sourced data would make me
feel a lot better about it's usage. As an artist I would personally be willing to donate art to a green data model that asks rather than takes.
