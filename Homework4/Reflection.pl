    I used the Flying Spaghetti Monster from Futurama because it's one of my favorite shows and the character has a really
    silly design. I wanted it to feel like you were chasing the plate around the screen in a playful "turning of the tables"
    kind of way. I could see innevitably adding collision and maybe some kind of score tracker so that every time the player
    catches the plate, they get a point. I can see how displaying images this way could be really useful for all kinds of projects.
    you could easily make those images cycle using an array to create simple animations.
