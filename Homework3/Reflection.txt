    This week I found a p5js sketch generated by AI that was the closest thing to the sketch I created. I have to say the AI gen art is really cool looking. It makes me 
wonder what kind of prompt was used. In my limited experience you really have to be specific with AI so I woud say the prompt was either really long and specific or
it was completely random. AI, much like computers doesn't usually do things unless you tell it to even if you don't realize you told it to do that thing. On the
other hand if you just tell AI to generate something random you might also end up with an image like this one. All in all the AI generated image is really cool 
looking and I appreciate the similarities it has to my sketch. Admittedly my sketch doesn't have as much of an identity as the AI generated one which is maybe a little
ironic. My scetch makes use of random shapes with trails that contrasts well with th background whereas the AI generated one has a more cohesive look with the colors 
and shapes. 
   
    These reflections really make me ponder the future of AI and it's relationship with code and art. More and more I think it's up to us as users of these technologies
to actively direct their course. How can we use these assistants responsibly in a way that makes our lives better and not JUST easier? One of the biggest problems I run
into when coding is remembering all the diffferent tags, functions, and symbols. I think I've actually come up with an app I could develop to help with this. Imagine a
translator of sorts that takes english and translates it into code. The possibilities really are endless.
